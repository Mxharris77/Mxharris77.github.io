 When I was in 6th grade I was apart of a magnet program at my middle school. The main focus of the program I was in was math, science and computer science. Although I wasn’t the best, computer science was my favorite class. Ever since then I’ve had a passion for programming. Besides 3 years of programming I took computer classes every opportunity I got. When I got to college I was told the course load for computer science would be extremely vigorous and too much to handle as a freshman student athlete. When I transferred schools I was told the same thing but to make matters worse, I was given an entire schedule of sociology classes. Knowing I had to decide a major by the end of the next semester I opted to be a sociology major and take whatever computer classes I could. Now that I’ve graduated college with my sociology degree I can work towards achieving one of my long term goals through this program.
